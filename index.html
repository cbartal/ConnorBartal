                <p style="color:white; font-size:15px">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                    book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                    more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <p style="color:white; font-size:15px">In May of 2021, I will graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA (see enclosed resume). Due to the nature of my course work, I am proficient in Java and C, with exposure to Python, HTML, JavaScript,
                    and SQL. I have worked with both Windows and Linux operating systems and also have experience with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Previously, I have worked for Genworth Financial and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.
                    At Genworth, I was assigned to their ServiceNow Admin team where I helped with day to day responsibilities as well as kick starting the implementation of Major Incident Management. During my time at the Federal Reserve, I helped an
                    Oracle database team with documentation, cleanup, and testing.</p>

                <p style="color:white; font-size:15px">Unfortunatly I am unavailable for hire. I am a part of the Department of Defense Cyber Scholarship Program and by contract with them can not seek employment oppurtunities elsewhere. (see below for more information)</p>

                <p style="color:white; font-size:15px">In May of 2019 I was blessed to receive an offer to become part of the Department of Defense Cyber Scholarship Program. The scholarship provides full tuition, a stipend to cover basic living expenses, all school fees, and travel expenses
                    for degree related events. More information can be found on the <a style="color:#55ACEE" href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Cyber-Workforce/CySP/Scholarship/" target="blank__">DOD
                        website</a>. I have/will be a part of this program for two years. Meaning I owe two years of service. I will be completing my service obligation through the Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic (NIWC). More information about
                    my duties to NIWC as well as information about NIWC can be found on my <a style="color:#55ACEE" href="/Home/Work">Word Experience</a> page.</p>
